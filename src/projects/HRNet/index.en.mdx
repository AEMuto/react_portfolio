HRnet was the final project I completed during my training at Openclassrooms. It represents a complete modernization of a human resources management application, transforming an aging jQuery codebase into a modern, high-performance React application.

This internal CRM-style application comprises two main features: a sophisticated employee registration system with an elaborate form, and an interactive data table for visualizing and managing employee information. The project's complexity lies in creating a fluid user experience while managing potentially complex application state.

A particularly interesting aspect of the project was the development of a reusable React component library, including:
- A customizable calendar and date/time picker
- A flexible loading indicator with customizable styling options
- An adaptable dropdown menu for various interface needs
- Modal and data table components

Data persistence is handled locally through LocalForage, providing a robust storage solution that leverages IndexedDB, with WebSQL and localStorage as fallbacks. This approach enables an offline-first experience while maintaining excellent performance even with substantial data volumes.

## Technologies Used
- TypeScript for code safety and maintainability
- React for user interface
- Redux Toolkit for centralized state management
- LocalForage for data persistence
- Styled-Components for modular styling
- Vite for an optimized development environment

## What Was the Goal?
This project presented a specific technical challenge: transforming an existing jQuery application into a modern React solution. The objective wasn't simply to reproduce existing functionality but to enhance it by leveraging the advantages offered by the modern React ecosystem.

Creating a [React component library](https://github.com/AEMuto/AntoineMarseaud_14_HRnet_React_Library_23032022) represents a significant aspect of the project. This library, published separately, demonstrates a deep understanding of React's modularity and reusability principles.

The use of TypeScript and Redux Toolkit helped establish a robust and maintainable codebase, while LocalForage integration provides an elegant solution for data persistence. The end result is an application that's faster, more reliable, and easier to maintain than its jQuery predecessor.
