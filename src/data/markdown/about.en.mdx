As an ancient student of the École Nationale Supérieures des Arts Décoratifs (ENSAD), I combine expertise in **graphic design** and **computer programming**. I strengthened my skills by obtaining a [Front-End Application Developer certification](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AwKbIMiY2SxpIzmVC-vIE7CnJIe1zQD3/view?usp=sharing) from Openclassrooms.

Thanks to this training and my own researches, I improved my understanding of current standards expected in web applications. The projects I completed during this period gave me the opportunity to learn how to write maintainable and easily understandable code. Additionally, I acquired foundations in more advanced concepts, such as **object-oriented programming** and the **MVC** software architecture pattern.

Knowing that in the digital field, technologies evolve rapidly, I dedicate much of my free time to improving my knowledge and I always seek to put it into practice through real and concrete situations. The latest projects I worked on allowed me to familiarize myself with **API** development, **Web Apps with databases**, and practice hosting and deploying applications with **Vercel**, **Heroku**, or via a **VPS** on Hetzner. Since **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** are the building blocks of any website, I like to stay informed about their evolution and new features.

Currently looking for a Front-End developer position, I'm eager to participate in exciting and challenging projects.
